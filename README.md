# HardcoreScrollbar
Fork of [buzinas/simple-scrollbar](https://github.com/buzinas/simple-scrollbar) with added functionality.

## Benefits

Compared to the original:

- dynamic detection of native scrollbar size
- support for high dpi screens and nonstandard interfaces
- mobile support (scrollbar size 0, fallback to native)
- fixed minimum handle height causing overflow out of container
- dynamic updates on container content change (no need for hover)
- support for resizing scrollbar track with proper drag scaling
